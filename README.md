# CS-330-Final-Project

# How do I approach designing software?
Understanding the issue area and determining the essential requirements and user demands are the first steps in my software design process. I divide the system into more manageable, modular parts, which facilitates efficient project planning and execution. I made sure the design made advantage of my technical abilities, including working with geometric forms, texture mapping, and lighting methods, while concentrating on producing an understandable and relevant office environment for this 3D scene project. My ability to strike a balance between technical accuracy and creative inventiveness has improved as a result of this endeavor. Designing the setting, developing reusable features, and iterating on design aspects on a regular basis were all part of the process. Future work can employ strategies like modularity and iterative refinement to guarantee scalability, maintainability, and flexibility across a range of projects.

# How do I approach developing programs?
I take a methodical approach to software development, giving modularity and iterative improvement top priority. I implemented novel techniques for the 3D scene, such as the use of modular functions for camera transformations, lighting setups, and material properties. In order to make the environment both aesthetically pleasing and easy to use, iteration was crucial in perfecting elements like item placement, lighting changes, and navigation controls. I improved my coding techniques throughout the project by segmenting work into reusable functions, which allowed for effective debugging and adaptability for upcoming improvements. These techniques have strengthened my development process and enabled me to produce solutions that are both excellent and flexible.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
The tools and frameworks that computer science offers enable the development of creative and significant solutions in a variety of fields, including software development and computational graphics. I've gained useful abilities in rendering, material design, and camera movement from working on this 3D scene project that I can use in both my academic and professional endeavors. These abilities let students pursue advanced coursework in game design, animation, and graphics in the classroom. In a professional sense, they help me become ready for jobs in fields like simulation, virtual reality, and gaming, where it's critical to be able to blend technical know-how with imagination. I now see more ways that technology can be utilized to solve real-world issues and provide immersive experiences thanks to computational graphics and visualizations.
